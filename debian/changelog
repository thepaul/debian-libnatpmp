libnatpmp (20110808-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Thomas Goirand ]
  * Moves the natpmpc inside a new natpmp-utils package (Closes: #639084).
  * Removes Debian specific natpmpc.1, since upstream integrated it in his
    upstream tarball.

  [ Stanislav Maslovski ]
  * debian/control:
    - no need to build-depend/depend on python: python module is not built
    - corrected libnatpmp1 dependencies
    - corrected libnatpmp-dev dependencies
    - natpmp-utils replaces older libnatpmp binaries
    - linatpmp1 suggests natpmp-utils
  * debian/rules:
    - do not move files by hand, use dh_install
    - install docs and changelogs only once
  * new files:
    - natpmp-utils.install, natpmp-utils.manpages,
      libnatpmp-dev.install, libnatpmp1.install
  * removed files:
    - libnatpmp1.shibls (not needed; autogenerated by dh_makeshlibs),
      manpages
