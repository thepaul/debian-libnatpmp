Description: portable and fully compliant implementation of NAT-PMP
 NAT-PMP is the direct concurrent to the UPnP IGD specification. It is
 providing a way to do NAT traversal. It is part of the Bonjour protocol
 specifications. At the moment it is mainly supported by Apple software and
 hardware. For a way to add NAT-PMP capabilities to your *BSD, Linux or
 (Open)Solaris Router, you should have a look at MiniUPnPd which is
 supporting NAT-PMP in addition to UPnP since December 2007 ! 
 .
 libnatpmp is an attempt to make a portable and fully compliant
 implementation of the protocol NAT-PMP for the client side. It is based on non
 blocking sockets and all calls of the API are asynchronous. It is therefore
 very easy to integrate the NAT-PMP code to any event driven code. 
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
